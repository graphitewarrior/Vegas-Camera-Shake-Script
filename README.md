Simple Camera Shake effect</h1></head>

<h4> "It will create a "camera during earthquake" movement on the selected video clip. It uses Pan + Crop keyframes to achieve this. It is fully configurable."

<h2>Fork/Update Notes:</h2>
<p>This is a fork compatible with newer versions of VEGAS that do not use the same pathways as the original. I also added "Autosize" to all the UI elements so they are more accessible on differently sized screens, though I am yet to test it and am happy to fix any scaling issues. </p>
<p>I am also aware that there is <a href=https://github.com/rojaoo/VegasShakeScript>another fork of this script updated for newer versions of VEGAS by Rojaoo</a>! </p>
<p>I only noticed it after I had already completed my version haha. The method used to change the UI is different in both of them, so feel free to use either. </p>

<h2>How to Install:</h2>

            <li>Download this code. It should end up in your Downloads folder as a cs file. </li>
            <li>Put the cs file in the Script Menu folder of VEGAS. Here's the path: C:\Program Files\VEGAS\VEGAS Pro 21.0\Script Menu
                 <p> (note: your version of VEGAS might differ from mine, so make sure to put the right program name in!).</p> </li>
